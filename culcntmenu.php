<h3>Street Play</h3>
<p>
<br>
Be it Shakuntala or Pandora, Draupadi or Mary Magdelene, women have always been at the centre of
the world's history. Yet, the events of the recent past have reminded us that we are living in what the
Vedas have called the Kalyug. And there have sadly been innumerable movies, essays and speeches
vindicating the perpetrators and victimising the victimised. We believe it is thus time to spread a
message. A message that will serve as a firm reminder, or even an ultimatum to those who have
forgotten the place that a "Stree" has in this world, in their life. We thus exhort you to come forth and
deliver this message in a way as creative and unique as possible. Be the trumpeters of change. Be the
harbingers of a revolution!

<h3>Origami</h3>
<p>
	Origami (折り紙, from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku) is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, which started in the 17th century AD at the latest and was popularized outside of Japan in the mid-1900s. It has since then evolved into a modern art form. The goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques, and as such the use of cuts or glue are not considered to be origami.
